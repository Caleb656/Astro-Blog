## Description
> After a simple jewelry heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.

### My Brief Review
> Reservoir Dogs is a classic crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino, and the first Tarantino movie I watched. The film is known for its non-linear storytelling and its strong focus on dialogue. The non-linear storytelling was disorienting at first, but I quickly began to appreciate it as the movie went on. The premise of a simple jewelry heist gone wrong doesn't sound too interesting, as its been played out in many other movies, but the strength of this show is in the dialogue. Each character has a very unique personality, and the heist is their first time interacting with eachother. Overall this lead to a dramatic, at times hilarious, and dark movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes crime movies or Tarantino movies.

**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
